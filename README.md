# eQTL-set-analysis

## Overview

`eQTL-set-analysis` is a trial to assess the level of association of gene sets which contain a gene of interest from eQTL coexpression data. This data should already be processed with p-values indicating the strength of association to the phenotype already determened. We are hypothesizing that a set of genes within the same pathway will have an increased association with the phenotype of interest compared to the association of any one gene's expression to the phenoytpe. This is particularly applicable in GWAS/QTL studies where the phenotype of interest is suspected to be complex involves epistasis, or if effect of a gene's expression is suspected to have incomplete penetrance.
